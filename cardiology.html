              <p>
                The study and treatment of the heart and the circulatory system
                in animals are referred to as veterinary cardiology. Human
                beings need a healthy heart to live a long and healthy life. The
                same is true for pets, whose cardiac health is our primary
                concern. Much like their human companions, pets can develop a
                range of heart-related disorders, requiring the availability of
                competent veterinary cardiac treatment. Heart diseases aren’t
                preventable, but other measures can be taken to keep your pet’s
                heart as healthy as it can be. Weight management, balanced
                diets, and frequent exercise are essential to keeping your pet
                in good shape and preventing additional stressors to the heart,
                like diseases and injuries. However, even when your pet looks to
                have a clean bill of health, annual exams shouldn’t be
                underestimated. Allowing your veterinarian to examine your pet
                is the key to prolonging your pet’s life.

              <h3>FAQs</h3>
              <h4>How do I know if my cat has cardiac problems?</h4>
              <p>
                If you have a cat, you may have noticed that they have trouble
                breathing or is wheezing. Several conditions, including heart
                disease, can cause this. If your cat exhibits any of these
                symptoms, it’s essential to take them to the vet immediately so
                it can be checked out for cardiac problems. If you suspect your
                pet has some heart disease, several tests can be done at home
                before visiting the vet’s office.
              </p>
              <h4>Can heart disease be managed in cats?</h4>
              <p>
                Heart disease is a common problem in cats. It can be managed,
                but the treatment needs to be tailored to the cat’s unique needs
                and preferences.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your cat has heart disease, you may ask your veterinarian
                about medications to treat humans with heart problems. The same
                medicine will not work for your pet because many factors (such
                as weight) make animals’ bodies differ from humans. If you’re
                interested in using medication for your pet’s health benefits,
                talk with your vet first about what they recommend and how long
                it should be taken before trying something new out on them!
              </p>
              <h4>What are the most common heart diseases in cats?</h4>
              <p>The most common heart diseases in cats are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This disease affects the muscles of your cat’s heart and
                  causes it to become weak or sluggish.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Heart failure. Your cat may have this condition if he can’t
                  get enough oxygen into his bloodstream, possibly due to an
                  underlying lung or heart problem or because there are too many
                  fluids around his lungs (congestive heart failure).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Valvular diseases such as mitral regurgitation and pulmonary
                  artery stenosis (narrowing). These conditions make it harder
                  for blood to flow through your cat’s arteries—and if you have
                  both problems at once, it could quickly lead to congestive
                  heart failure!

                        FOOD DELIVERY Feeding your pets high quality food gives them a chance at a longer and healthier life. Like humans, pets also require essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Poor nutrition can have serious effects like obesity, allergies, fur loss, and emaciation. Unbalanced diets, especially during your pets’ growing phase, can result in detrimental health consequences. Indicators for poor nutrition you should look out for include bad breath, hair loss, dull coat, body odor, unusual bowel movements, and dandruff. At the Pet Friends we understand that cats and dogs are more than just pets, they are family. That is why we are devoted to supplying even the most discerning pet owners with a wide assortment of curated pet food, including organic and veterinary prescription diets. We also stock environmentally-friendly toys, training tools, treats, and grooming products. We carefully monitor pet food recalls and supply only the highest-grade goods. You can be certain, if it’s Pet Friends approved, it’s safe!

                        Skin-related issues are not limited to human beings and can plague animals too. Much like their owners, pets should also have regular visits to the dermatologist. Like us, pets can suffer from skin rashes, allergies, infections and other related issues, which can be aggravated by the hot climatic conditions. Since animals spend most of their time walking and lying down on the ground, their skin is more prone to contracting infections and to being aggravated. Skin conditions in pets should not be taken lightly because of the possibility of the disease being transmissible to you. Pet health can be beneficial to the overall health of your household. Our veterinary dermatologists are highly trained in treating skin, hair, and ear conditions in pets.
